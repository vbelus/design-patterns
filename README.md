# design-patterns
A comprehensive collection of software design patterns implemented with practical examples. This repository covers Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns, with code examples. The aim is for me to have used all these patterns at least once to better understand them.

Below is the checklist of patterns to track the progress of implementation:

- [ ] Resource Acquisition Is Initialization  
- [ ] Singleton  

### Structural Patterns
- [ ] Adapter  
- [ ] Bridge  
- [ ] Composite  
- [x] **Decorator**
- [ ] Facade
