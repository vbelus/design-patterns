# Python Decorators: Two Approaches to Implementation

This repository showcases two distinct approaches to implementing decorators in Python:

1. **Modern Python Decorators with `@` Syntax**:  
   Found in the `maths` directory, this approach leverages Python's `@` syntax to apply decorators in a concise and readable manner.

2. **Classical Decorator Design Pattern**:  
   Found in the `text_format` directory, this approach adheres to the traditional structural design pattern, avoiding Python's `@` syntax in favor of explicitly wrapping objects.
